 Library Management System

Project Overview
Library Management System is a web application that uses the Django framework in Python. It offers a convenient method of managing books, users, and transactions within a library. The system is able to automate book lending, reminders for due dates, and user account management.

Libraries usually have problems with hand-keeping books and ineffective tracking systems. The project was developed to:
- Automate book management and lending processes.
- Enhance the efficiency of book searches and transactions.
- Minimize manual errors in book borrowing and returns.
- Offer a simple-to-use interface for librarians and users.

 Tech Stack
- Backend: Django (Python)
- rontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Database: SQLite (default), can be changed to PostgreSQL/MySQL
